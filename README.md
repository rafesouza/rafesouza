## 👋 Hello, I'm rafesouza!

🧑‍💻 About Me

Since 1996, when I had my first experience with programming through DBASE (both programmed and interactive), technology has always been part of my journey. After that initial experience, I worked for many years in the commercial and technical areas of IT companies, gaining a broad and practical view of the industry.

Today, I am taking a new path by studying Software Engineering at university, aiming to deepen my knowledge and turn my passion for technology into practical and innovative solutions.

🚀 Skills in Development

🐍 Python 3 (my main language at the moment)

☕ Basic knowledge of Java

🌐 Introductory knowledge of HTML

🌱 Always Learning

My goal is to grow as a developer and explore new technologies, frameworks, and programming languages. I’m always looking for challenges that help me evolve and contribute to meaningful projects.
